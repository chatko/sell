# Deprecating your service from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog
{: #deprecate-3p-service}

This topic is WIP. Staging only for now.
{: note}

If you need to permanently delete your service from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, you can initiate the deprecation of your product. Your product remains available for use during a 90-day deprecation period, and is removed after 90 days.
{: shortdesc}

To initiate the deprecation of your service, complete the following steps:

1. Contact a Partner Center onboarding specialist by sending an email to the `cloud.onboarding@ibm.com` email address. In your email, include the reason and the preferred time of product deprecation.
1. Provide the notification message that you want to send out to your existing customers. This way, the onboarding specialist can notify them that your service is going to be deprecated and the support for the product also ends. See the following example of a deprecation notification email:

   ```text
   Subject: Example product will be removed from the IBM Cloud catalog on May 9, 2023

   Body:
