# Inviting team members to help onboard your product
{: #sw-invite-team}

If you want to enlist team members to help onboard your product to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can invite them to your account. Certain onboarding tasks, for example, creating or onboarding a service broker require a technical member of your team, who can help you completing these technical tasks. By inviting team members to your account, they are automatically assigned the required access to complete the onboarding tasks. For more information about the roles that are assigned to team members, see [Managing access for Partner Center - Sell](/docs/sell?topic=sell-iam-access-pc-sell&interface=ui).
