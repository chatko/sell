# Inviting team members to help onboard software
{: #sw-invite-team}

If you want to enlist team members to help onboard your third-party software to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can invite them to your account. By inviting team members to your account, they are automatically assigned the required access to complete the onboarding tasks.

When you invite team members to your account, they are assigned editor access to the following services by default:

* Partner Center - Sell: Editors can complete onboarding tasks, update the visibility of products at the account level, and request approval to publish products to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
* Catalog management: Editors can onboard products to private catalogs, update the visibility of products at the account and private catalog levels, and restrict the visibility of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

Complete the following steps to invite team members to your account:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My team**.
1. Click **Invite users**.
1. Enter the email address of each user.
1. Click **Invite**.
