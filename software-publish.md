# Publishing your software
{: #sw-publish}

As the last step in the onboarding process, you can submit a request to publish your third-party software to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. When you publish your software to the catalog, you can choose to publish it to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} users in the catalog or to only specific accounts. If you choose to publish to specific accounts, your product is available only for users in those accounts.
