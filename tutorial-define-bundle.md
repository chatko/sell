# Defining the product details of your Operator bundle
{: #bundle-define}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="15m"}

This tutorial walks you through the steps for defining the details of an Operator bundle in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Partner Center. By completing this tutorial, you review and sign the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement, and define your catalog entry and product page, pricing model, and support experience.
{: shortdesc}

This tutorial is one of four in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a sample Operator bundle from the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} Certified registry. It uses a fictitious company that's called *Example Corp*. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your product's needs.

## Before you begin
{: #bundle-define-prereqs}

[Register your Operator bundle](/docs/sell?topic=sell-bundle-register).

## Confirm the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement
{: #bundle-dra}
{: step}

As a third-party provider, you are required to sign the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement if you plan to offer free plans for your product. The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement sets the terms and conditions under which providers can onboard and sell products in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Or, you can upload a custom digital provider agreement in `.pdf`, `.doc`, or `.docx` file format.

Custom digital provider agreements must be reviewed and approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, which increases the time it takes for you to complete the onboarding process. The uploaded files are scanned for viruses, which might take a few minutes to complete. If a virus is detected, it is recommended to run another virus scan on your file, and then try uploading it again.
{: note}

For the purposes of this tutorial, complete the following steps to sign the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement.

1. From the My products page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Partner Center, click **Provide details** in the notification that explains that company details are required.
1. Choose **I plan to offer free and usage-based pricing plans** from the Agreements section.
1. Click the **{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement** link to review the agreement.
1. Select **I have read and agree to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement.**, and click **Save**.

## Provide your product name and type
{: #bundle-name}
{: step}

You can add a new product or import an existing product from a private catalog. For the purposes of this tutorial, add a product.

1. From the **My products** page in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Partner Center, click **Create**.
1. Click **Create a product**, and click **Next > Start now**.
1. Select **Software** as the type of product that you're onboarding, and click **Next**.

    The product type is used for tax assessment purposes. For more information, see [Selling on IBM Cloud](/docs/sell?topic=sell-selling-clouds).
    {: important}

1. Enter the display name of your Operator bundle as it appears in the {{site.data.keyword.redhat_notm}} registry in the product name field. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can enter `Akka Cluster Operator`. 
1. Optionally, enter the programmatic name of your product, and click **Next**.
1. Review your product details and click **Create**.

## Define your catalog entry and product page
{: #bundle-catalog}
{: step}

Provide details that are displayed on your catalog entry and product page when your Operator bundle is published in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

1. Click **Catalog entry** > **Add logo**, and enter the URL to your company or product logo, such as `http://svgur.com/i/TTP.svg`.
1. Provide a short description of your product, which is displayed on your catalog entry. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can enter `This Operator is a developer tool.`
1. From the **Category** list, select an option that best fits how users might use your product, for example, **Developer tools**. Categories are used to organize products in the catalog based on common solutions, function, or use.
   You can add additional filters to your product after you have onboarded a version of your software. For more information, see [Adding additional filters to your software](/docs/sell?topic=sell-software-filters).
   {: note}

1. Enter keywords that users might use when they search the catalog for your product, for example, `dev tools` and `operator`.
1. Provide a list of features that highlights your product's attributes and benefits for users.

   Use a descriptive title and 1 - 2 sentences for each feature. You want the information to be visually scannable for users.
   {: tip}

1. Provide a detailed description of your product that explains its value and what users gain by using it. The detailed description is displayed at the beginning of your product page in the catalog. You can expand on the short description that you provide for your catalog entry, but don't simply repeat it.
1. Provide links to high-quality images or videos to help illustrate what your product is, its value, and user benefits. The supported media types are images, videos in MP4 or WebM file format, and videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo.

   Some examples of effective media include an introductory walkthrough of your product, an explanation of what your product is and why users might want to use it, or a comparison of certain features.
   {: tip}

1. Provide a link to your product's warranted documentation.

## Defining your pricing model
{: #bundle-pricing}
{: step}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports two pricing models: free or bring your own license (BYOL). With the free pricing model, users can deploy as many instances with no additional charges incurred. With the BYOL pricing model, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} doesn't charge users for the usage of the product, and third-party providers are responsible for licensing entitlement and enforcement.

For the purposes of this tutorial, offer your Operator bundle for free by clicking **Pricing**, and selecting **Free**.

## Define your support experience
{: #bundle-support}
{: step}

Provide details that help users understand how to get support if they encounter issues when they use the Operator bundle. For more information about providing support information, see [Defining your support experience](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-support-details).

To define your product's support experience, use the following steps:
