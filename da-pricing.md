# Reviewing pricing details
{: #da-pricing}

This topic is in progress.
{: note}

Deployable architectures have no cost, although the resources that they create might have their own licenses or costs. You can review the estimated starting cost of your product that can be a starting point to help you determine how much your customers would be charged for deploying the architecture.

## Before you begin

Before you can review the pricing details of your deployable architecture, you must add at least one variation to your product as that has an estimated starting cost.
