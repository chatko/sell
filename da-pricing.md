# Reviewing pricing details
{: #da-pricing}

Deployable architectures have no costs, although the resources that they create might have their own licenses or costs. You can review the estimated starting cost of your product, which can be a starting point to help you determine how much your customers would be charged for deploying the architecture.

## Before you begin
{: #before-da-pricing}

Before you can review the pricing details of your deployable architecture, you must add at least one variation to your product as that has an estimated starting cost. For more information, see [Adding deployable architecture variations](/docs/sell?topic=sell-da-variation).

## Reviewing the estimated starting cost of your product
{: #review-da-cost}

You can review the estimated resource costs of your product by completing the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center > My products**.
1. Select your product and go to the Variation page.
1. Select a variation from the table by clicking it. Then, go to the Pricing tab.
1. Select a product version in the Estimated resource costs section.
1. Review the estimated starting cost of the resources that your product creates.

The estimated resource cost table lists the resources that your product uses and their estimated costs. Starting cost is an estimate based on available data. It does not include all resources, usage, license, fees, discounts, or taxes.
