# Defining your pricing model for software
{: #sw-pricing}

When onboarding your product, you need to define the pricing model for your software. Currently, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog supports free plans and bring your own license (BYOL).
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs-sw-plans}

Before you can submit a pricing plan for approval, you must sign the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Provider Agreement or the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement, which set the terms and conditions under which providers can onboard and sell products in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Or, you can upload a custom digital provider agreement in `.pdf`, `.doc`, or `.docx` file format.

Custom digital provider agreements must be reviewed and approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, which increases the time it takes for you to complete the onboarding process. The uploaded files are scanned for viruses, which might take a few minutes to complete. If a virus is detected, it is recommended to run another virus scan on your file, and then try uploading it again.
