# Defining your pricing model for software
{: #sw-pricing}

When onboarding your product, you need to define the pricing model for your software. Currently, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog supports free plans and bring your own license (BYOL).

{: ui}

By adding a free plan, you are indicating that your product does not require any payment or license to use.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My products**.
1. Select the product that you're onboarding, and click **Pricing**.
1. Select **Free**.

## Adding a BYOL plan by using the console
{: #pricing-byol}
{: ui}

By adding a bring your own license plan, you are indicating that customers need to purchase a license to use your product. You are required to provide the name of the license and a URL where customers can purchase the license.

If you have not imported a version of your software, you can still create a BYOL plan. However, you need to import a version before your product is published. For more information, see [Onboarding your software](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-validate).
