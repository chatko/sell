# Restoring a deprecated product or version
{: #restore-deprecated-product}

After you deprecate your product or version, your software enters a 90-day deprecation period before it is removed from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. During this deprecation period, you can't make changes to your product, but you can restore your software to its last published state to keep it in the catalog. Your software cannot be restored after the 90-day deprecation period.
